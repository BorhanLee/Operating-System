- What is Operating systems (OS) and its key concepts?
    
    [Key Concepts of OS](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Key%20Concepts%20of%20OS%20d0703d6dc67844959b74a6eee8931731.md)
    

Operating systems (OS) are complex software that serves as an intermediary between computer hardware and user applications. They manage various resources and provide an interface for users to interact with the system. Key concepts of operating systems include:

1. **Process Management**:
    
    [Process & Thread](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Process%20&%20Thread%20a58ac55319504bef9f1b96d21740fe4d.md)
    
    [Heap vs Stack](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Heap%20vs%20Stack%209adf0d5205904e9fbf549488b835f2d6.md)
    
    [**Synchronization**](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Synchronization%20e1273a4490ad413aae51690431686bc9.md)
    
    - **Processes**: Units of execution that represent running programs. The OS manages processes, scheduling them for execution, allocating resources, and providing inter-process communication.
    - **Scheduling**: Deciding which processes to run when, using scheduling algorithms like First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin, etc.
    - **Synchronization**: Ensuring proper coordination between concurrent processes, preventing issues like race conditions and deadlocks.
2. **Memory Management**:
    
    [Paging](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Paging%2067458bb57db84b3da5c0fcff0983dc2a.md)
    
    [Virtual Memory](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Virtual%20Memory%2057b95c389d6e47a49447d520fb6db29e.md)
    
    [Memory Protection](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Memory%20Protection%20eed3d58c48df4153ba97540b301ab4f0.md)
    
    - **Virtual Memory**: Mechanism for efficiently managing memory by using secondary storage (like hard drives) as an extension of RAM.
    - **Address Translation**: Converting logical addresses used by programs into physical addresses in memory.
    - **Memory Allocation**: Assigning portions of memory to processes, and managing allocation and deallocation.
3. **File System Management**:
    
    [File System](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/File%20System%20848c865bf5cd4650ba53b9599e7b5a61.md)
    
    - **File Systems**: Organizing and managing data stored on secondary storage devices like hard drives.
    - **File Operations**: Providing mechanisms for creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.
    - **Directory Structures**: Organizing files into hierarchical structures for easy navigation.
4. **Device Management**:
    - **Device Drivers**: Software components that facilitate communication between the OS and hardware devices.
    - **I/O Operations**: Managing input and output operations to and from devices such as keyboards, printers, disks, etc.
    - **Interrupt Handling**: Responding to hardware interrupts generated by devices.
5. **Security**:
    
    [Security](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Security%20892bdaf2467443ccae02db05bb80ca26.md)
    
    - **Authentication and Authorization**: Verifying the identity of users and determining their level of access.
    - **Data Protection**: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
    - **User Privileges**: Controlling what actions users can perform on the system.
6. **Networking**:
    
    [Networking](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Networking%20a6ef0e9386fd4733820cc030197afa42.md)
    
    [Socket](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/Socket%2091f9a843739f498a863b1a432cc10c6f.md)
    
    - **Network Protocols**: Implementing communication protocols for networking tasks like sending and receiving data over networks.
    - **Socket Programming**: Providing interfaces for applications to communicate over a network using sockets.
    - **Resource Sharing**: Facilitating the sharing of network resources among multiple users and applications.
7. **User Interface**:
    
    [User mode and kernel mode](OS%20a702ea7d3d494d3aa0b1575b74e1ac6c/User%20mode%20and%20kernel%20mode%2066f92ace0f734065a8553fbb24cedecd.md)
    
    - **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Text-based interface for issuing commands to the operating system.
    - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Visual interface with windows, icons, menus, and pointers for user interaction.
    - **System Calls**: Interfaces for applications to request services from the operating system, like file operations or memory allocation.

These concepts collectively form the foundation of modern operating systems, which enable computers to efficiently manage resources, run multiple programs simultaneously, and provide a user-friendly environment for interaction.
